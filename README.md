# ChristalShaner.io

This is the first website I have ever built for myself, it was a great learning process and as I improve more in my skills, the site will reflect that.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this site. It is an "About Me" style website, using a neutral color palette (my favorite). You can even click a button to view my resume, as well as email me through a form at the bottom of the site! <br><br>
This project, while balancing school and other activites, took about 6 months give or take. The respective JS libraries and licenses are included in the licenses.txt folder for this site. I'm proud to use it to display my skills for now, someday I hope to actually build a site from the code!<br>
